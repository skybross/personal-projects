# Personal Projects

Contents:

* **Algorithmic Bias Lab**: iPython notebook and python dependency file, written as a lab assignment for CS 10, UC Berkeley's introductory computer science course. See launch page [here](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=berkeley_bjc/python/algorithmic-bias.topic&course=cs10_fa18.html&novideo&noreading&noassignment) for setup instructions. Designed to give students a hands-on introduction to algorithmic bias, the phenomenon where hidden patterns in datasets can skew algorithmic computations.

* **Database**: Java implementation of a subset of a SQL-esque query language. Includes functionality for creating tables, loading tables, storing tables, dropping tables, printing tables, inserting data, selecting data (with conditionals), and executing joins. Originally assigned as a project in my data structures course, but all code is authored by me (i.e., no skeleton was provided).

* **SAT Grader**: Java code that scores and scales students' results from diagnostic SAT exams. Also returns useful information about performance in key subtopic areas. Written to assist with diagnostic exam scoring when I teach SAT prep courses.
