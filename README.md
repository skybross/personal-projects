# Personal Projects

Contents:

* **SAT Grader**: Java code that scores and scales students' results from diagnostic SAT exams. Also returns useful information about performance in key subtopic areas. Written to assist with diagnostic exam scoring when I teach SAT prep courses.

* **Algorithmic Bias Lab**: iPython notebook and python dependency file, written as a lab assignment for CS 10, UC Berkeley's introductory computer science course. See launch page [here](https://beautyjoy.github.io/bjc-r/topic/topic.html?topic=berkeley_bjc/python/algorithmic-bias.topic&course=cs10_fa18.html&novideo&noreading&noassignment) for setup instructions. Written to give students a hands-on introduction to algorithmic bias, the phenomenon where hidden patterns in datasets can skew algorithmic computations.
